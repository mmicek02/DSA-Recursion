4. Nth Triangle Number

Calculate the nth triangular number. A triangular number counts the objects that 
can form an equilateral triangle. The nth triangular number is the number of dots 
composing a triangle with n dots on a side, and is equal to the sum of the n 
natural numbers from 1 to n. This is the Triangular Number Sequence: 1, 3, 6, 10, 
15, 21, 28, 36, 45.

5. String Splitter

6. Fibonacci
Write a recursive function that prints the Fibonacci sequence of a given number. The 
Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the 2

is 13. The sequence looks as follows: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.

7. Factorial
Write a recursive function that finds the factorial of a given number. The factorial

8. Find a way out of the maze
You have entered a Maze and need to find your way out of it. There are more than one

9. Find ALL the ways out of the maze
Use the above maze and modify your solution so it finds All the possible exit paths 
through the Maze. To find all possible exit paths through the maze, think about how 
many places you can move at each turn. Possibly up, down, left or right?

Notice that this maze has 3 exits paths. Your recursive function should print all 
three of the paths with the proper directions. For example, given the maze above, 
the program should output the following:

Path to the exit: RRDDLLDDRRRRRR
Path to the exit: RRDDRRUURRDDDD
Path to the exit: RRDDRRRRDD

/*
10. Anagrams
An anagram is any word or phrase that uses the letters of a given ("subject") word or 
phrase in another, rearranged order. Write a function that creates an anagram list, 
listing all the rearrangements of a given word. For example, if the user types "east", 
the program should list all 24 permutations, including "eats", "etas", "teas", and 
non-words like "tsae".

Hint: For your algorithm, you might want to think about a prefix and use that to create 
the new words. For example, given "east", use "e" as a prefix and place it in front of 
all 6 permutations of "ast" â€” "ast", "ats", "sat", "sta", "tas", and "tsa". This will 
give you the words "east", "eats", "esat", "esta", "etas", and "etsa". Continue this way 
until you find all the anagrams for "east". Then you can use "a" as a prefix and permute 
the remaining words "est". For "east", there should be 24 words.

12. Binary Representation
Write a recursive function that prints out the binary representation of a given number.
